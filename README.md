# Flappy-bird
## Overview
Created a Flappy bird rip-off for my brother to play.

## Dependencies
Install the "pygame" module before running the script. Also ensure that the gallery folder and the python script should be placed in the same directory. The gallery folder contains sounds and sprites used in the game.

Checkout the documentation for pygame here: https://www.pygame.org/docs/
